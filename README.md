**Yang Xue is one of the contributors of the project a team member at HeartBeat studio. He took the video, 
but our work is mutual in these projects (Can be verified)**
In this we reimagined a fan inspired remake of "Grand Chase" but with modern concepts and features. 
Game was developed and built with Unreal Engine, Unity Engine, C#, and C++
This was not the final/polished version, but this is what remained after completion of my time at HeartBeat Studio

In both projects I was one of the **main gameplay and network programmers**. 
Code is currently unavailable due to non-disclosure agreement(NDA) but explanation of how code works is available anytime.
