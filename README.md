**Yang Xue is one of the contributors of the project a team member at HeartBeat studio. He took the video, <br/>
but our work is mutual in these projects (Can be verified)**<br/>
In this we reimagined a fan inspired remake of "Grand Chase" but with modern concepts and features. <br/>
Game was developed and built with Unreal Engine, Unity Engine, C#, and C++<br/>
This was not the final/polished version, but this is what remained after completion of my time at HeartBeat Studio<br/>

In both projects I was one of the **main gameplay and network programmers**. <br/>

The game used both P2P(player to player) and dedicated master server network architecture.  <br/>

Code is currently unavailable due to non-disclosure agreement(NDA) but explanation of how code works is available anytime.
